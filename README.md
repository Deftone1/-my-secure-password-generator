# -my-secure-password-generator

I created this random password generator with some help starting code provided from the assignment and a little direction from my cousin (who too, went through a coding bootcamp.)

Below were my steps for the pseudo code:

- Create page for password generator

- Button is clicked to generate password

- First prompt displayed: User must enter preferred amount of characters (between 8-128)

- Second prompt displayed: User is asked if they would like lowercase letters

- Third prompt displayed: User is asked if they would like uppercase letters

- Fourth prompt displayed: User is asked if they would like special characters

- Random password is generated
